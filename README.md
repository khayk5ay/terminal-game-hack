The terminal Web3 Game

You have a list of 9 words and you are supposed to decipher the required word using clues

The first word you pick will most likely be a guess. 
After you pick the word, you get a clue.
This clue tells you how many letters in the specific word are in the same position in the required word (end goal word)
This clue ranges from 0 to the number of letters in the word

Based on this information, you can then eliminate words within the list that do not meet that criteria exactly
That is, words with less or more than the stated number in the same position.

The code helps you eliminate the ineligible candidates and based on the guess you made, and number clue you were given by the system
